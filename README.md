# PSEUDOCODE
## TASK 1
Q.Take three variables as input and add them without using the + operator (Use your head for this)
START

//input/output
INPUT NUM1
INPUT NUM2
INPUT NUM3

// variables and Initialization
SET NUM4 to 0
SET SUM to 0

// Process Steps
NUM4 = 0-NUM1-NUM2-NUM3
SUM = NUM4 * -1

PRINT SUM
END/

##TASK 2

Q.Create a small calculator which only does ‚Äò+‚Äô or ‚Äò-‚ÄòOperations. (Hint: Take three variable inputs with
one being used for the operator)

START

//input/output
INPUT NUM1
INPUT NUM2
INPUT operations


// variables and Initialization
SET NUM3 to 0

// Conditional Statements
IF operations = "+"
	NUM3 = NUM1 + NUM2 
	PRINT NUM3
ELSE IF 
	operations = "-"
	NUM3 = NUM1 - NUM2
	PRINT NUM3
ELSE
	PRINT "Invalid Operations"\

#Algorithm
##TASK1
 
Q.Implement an algorithm for determining if an Nth is a divisor of an n Number (i.e. 2 is a divisor of 6).
If so, determine if it‚Äôs an even number or odd number as well.

1. ask the user to enter Nth number 
2. ask the user to enter n number
3. calculate n MOD Nth
4. IF MOD is 0 then print "Nth is a devisor of n" ELSE print "Nth is not a devisor of n"
5. calculate n MOD 2 
5. IF MOD is 0 then print "n is even" ELSE print "n is odd"


##TASK2
Q.Implement an algorithm for making a simple calculator with all the operators (+,-,*,/,%)
1. ask the user to enter NUM1
2. ask the user to enter NUM2
3. ask the user to enter operation
4. NUM3 = 0
5. IF the operation is "+" NUM3 = NUM1 + NUM2
6. ELSE IF the operation is "-" NUM3 = NUM1 - NUM2
7. ELSE IF the operation is "*" NUM3 = NUM1 * NUM2
8. ELSE IF the operation is "/" NUM3 = NUM1 / NUM2
9. ELSE IF the operation is "%" NUM3 = NUM1 / NUM2 * 100
10. ELSE PRINT "operations is invalid"
11. PRINT NUM3
