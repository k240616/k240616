    <div class="vision">
      <h1><u><b>My vision</b></u></h1>
      <h3>My vision is to start my career by contributing to my country’s intelligence agency, where I aim to use my skills in cybersecurity and problem-solving to strengthen national security. I’m driven by the idea of protecting critical information and infrastructure from cyber threats and supporting the agency's mission to maintain safety on a larger scale. This experience would allow me to develop a deep understanding of complex security challenges and cutting-edge defense strategies. Later in life, I plan to leverage this expertise by establishing my own software house or security agency, focused on creating innovative solutions for cyber defense and digital protection. Through this path, I hope to make a lasting impact on both national security and the tech industry, fostering a secure and resilient digital landscape.</h3>

    <div class="inspiration">
      <h1><u><b>My inspiration</b></u></h1>
      <h3>I'm deeply inspired by my father, who, after years of dedication and hard work, established his own business as a buying agency in 2016. Watching him pursue his goals with persistence and overcome challenges has taught me the value of resilience and ambition. His journey from gaining extensive experience in the industry to successfully building something of his own has shown me that with the right vision and commitment, one can create something meaningful and impactful. His success is a constant reminder of the power of perseverance, and it motivates me to follow my own path with the same determination and drive to eventually build a business of my own.</h3>

          <h3>One of my favorite memories is when I went to Ghulam Ishaq Khan Institute of Engineering Sciences and Technology (GIKI) with my friends to participate in the All Pakistan Math Olympiad (APMO). The experience was a perfect mix of excitement and challenge, as we explored the vibrant campus, worked through complex problems, and bonded over our shared passion for mathematics. It was inspiring to compete among some of the brightest minds from across the country, and the camaraderie we built during that trip made it even more special. That journey wasn't just about the competition; it was about the memories, the learning, and the joy of being part of something larger than ourselves.</h3>
